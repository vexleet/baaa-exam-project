            <h1>How To Play</h1>

            <p>Read the rules below and start having the most fun you will have in a while playing one of the best drinking games.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Get a sober referee</h2>
                        <p>In order to have a fun and fair game, it would be best if the referee is sober. Having one would also make the game more enjoyable as the sober one will be able to see who ever does something wrong rather than the one that is very drunk and doesn't know what is happening.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Create mine pool</h2>
                        <p>When you are about to start the game, you would have to create mines for your field. Mines are put on some or all circles in the field, based on user choice when creating the game. When you land on a mine you would have to do the drinking challenge without standing up in any way.</p>
                        <a href="game.html" class="main-button">Create mine pool</a>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Spin the wheel</h2>
                        <p>In order to start playing and getting wasted. You have to spin the wheel in order to move on the board and land on mines. Only the referee can spin the wheel and say where you have to put a body part on a color. After that the referee says the challenge you would have to do if you have landed on a mine</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Get Wasted</h2>
                        <p>The most important rule. To get wasted as the goal of the game is just that. To get wasted and of course have fun.</p>
